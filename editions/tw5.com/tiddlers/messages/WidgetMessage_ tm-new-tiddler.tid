The new tiddler message creates a new draft tiddler and adds it to the current story. It requires the following properties on the `event` object:

|!Name |!Description |
|param |Optional title of a tiddler to use as a template for the new tiddler |
|navigateFromTitle |Title of the tiddler from which the navigation to the new tiddler was initiated |

The new tiddler message is usually generated with the LinkWidget or the ButtonWidget and is handled by the NavigatorWidget.

! Example

To make a button that creates new tiddlers tagged "task", create a tiddler called "TaskTemplate" with that tag, and then make your button like this:

```
<$button message="tm-new-tiddler" param="TaskTemplate">New Task</$button>
```
